# Delver

## Summary

Welcome to Delver! An open-source TTRPG designed for free play and licensed under the MIT License. What all this means is that if you wish to add homebrew to the game or edit it you may do so via a pull request (more information under the contributing section) or a fork.

As you read through you may gain the sense that the system is somewhat generic and–while we have made efforts to create mechanics that are unique–it moderately resembles other systems you have played. This is because Delver exists to provide a free experience that will feel similar to other systems you have played that can be collaboratively developed and expanded.

## Core Mechanics

Delver is a d100 system, which is to say that you roll the two 10-sided dice that come in a standard dice set together and add them to get a result. The 10-sided die that has the numbers 0-9 on it is a d10. The 0 counts as a 10, not a 0. The other die is called a percentile die, and goes from 00-90. On this die, the 00 counts as 00. Otherwise, it would not be possible to roll a 100.

Characters are built around a small number of core attributes which feed into a large set of skills. These skills (and never the attributes except in very rare circumstances) are the basis of saving throws, checks, and attacks. On average a character will have a handful of proficiencies in skills and be largely unskilled in other areas.

Classes are organized into 4 main archetypes: 

```
Warrior
Mage
Rogue
Scholar
```
Each archetype has a bucket of class features which can be accessed at various milestones. Players will select these for their characters to customize them as they see fit, giving them the option for a highly diverse or highly focused character.

## Setting

Delver has a setting, but it exists only to help game masters develop their own content. It will be fleshed out in the future as an optional component to take the burden off GMs. 

Delver is set on a world of the same name that is in the early stages of technological renaissance. Armies are beginning to trade their spears and bows for firearms, sundials and water clocks are being replaced with mechanical clocks, and devices that can stamp whole sheets of paper with print are beginning to see use in the great cities of the world. But many corners of the world remain shrouded in darkness. There dark things stalk and wicked mortals may find refuge from judgment. 

In the depths there is treasure long forgotten and secrets best left undisturbed. In the heights of heaven are worlds innumerable, never before seen by the eye of any mortal born on Delver. And in the streets and byways close at hand are common troubles aplenty that call out for the strength and wisdom of an adventurer.
