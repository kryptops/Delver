# Delver

## Summary

Welcome to Delver! An open-source TTRPG designed for free play and licensed under the MIT License. What all this means is that if you wish to add homebrew to the game or edit it you may do so via a pull request (more information under the contributing section) or a fork.

As you read through you may gain the sense that the system is somewhat generic and–while we have made efforts to create mechanics that are unique–it moderately resembles other systems you have played. This is because Delver exists to provide a free experience that will feel similar to other systems you have played that can be collaboratively developed and expanded.

## Core Mechanics

Delver is a d100 system, which is to say that you roll the two 10-sided dice that come in a standard dice set together and add them to get a result. The 10-sided die that has the numbers 0-9 on it is a d10. The 0 counts as a 10, not a 0. The other die is called a percentile die, and goes from 00-90. On this die, the 00 counts as 00. Otherwise, it would not be possible to roll a 100.

Characters are built around a small number of core attributes which feed into a large set of skills. These skills (and never the attributes except in very rare circumstances) are the basis of saving throws, checks, and attacks.
